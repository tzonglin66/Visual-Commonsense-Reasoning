The dataset consists of image/metadata files, and annotations.
Each annotation file (train.jsonl, val.jsonl, and test.jsonl) is a jsonl file, where each line is a JSON object.
The test file has the labels removed, to preserve the integrity of the leaderboard.


Here are the important things from the annotations:
